Berkeley SETI notes
--------------------

this was modified for snap_control and definitely has diverged in a non-mergable way to upstream casperfpga. This is control software for FPGA boards, and we are running a particular OS on the SNAP boards which will not work with the newer casperfpga. This code is needed for operations at Parkes, but is not going to be further developed.
